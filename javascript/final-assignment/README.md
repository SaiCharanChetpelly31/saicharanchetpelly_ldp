Problem Statement:
"Hyderabad's top most restaurant wants ZeMoSo Labs to design a single page web app for dealing with their billing system, the app should be simple enough for waiters to take order on the go, and should be usable on mobiles too, the app should consist of menu and tables, order beings with start of a new session and when session ended, the app should generate bill for that particular table, the menu should be searchable and sort-able based on items, type of items, a drag-and-drop model might help the waiters dealing the busy hall."
